# GridMC Currency

This is a GridMC trial plugin used to test my abilities as a Java programmer.

# Setup

To setup the plugin, drag the jar located in /lib/build/ of the repo into your plugins directory. Follow these steps:

- Load server 1 time
- Stop server
- Enter the root directory of your Minecraft server
- Enter conf/
- Inside of conf/ is a file called "database.json"
- Enter your database info inside that file where appropriate

Thats all! The plugin automatically does the rest, enjoy!
